## Levels
- Adjusting waveform size
- You can change this with mic placement
- You can adjust the [microphone](Microphones.md) pre level
	- Higher level may capture more background noise
		- You may be able to use EQ to cut out background noise
- Ensure that the level is not so high to cause clipping (in the red region)
## Editing
- You can edit many aspects of a clip
### Chopping
- You can use scissor/split to split into multiple regions
### Cross Fade
- Fades in/out of the sample
- 0 crossing is the center line
	- If you hit the zero line you won't have a click
	- If you start above 0 you may get a click noise
		- You can cross fade the part above the 0 line to remove clicks at the start
## Signal Chain
Vocalist -> microphone -> cable -> audio interface (mic preamp) -> DAW (mixer, fx, processor) -> headset/monitors -> listener
