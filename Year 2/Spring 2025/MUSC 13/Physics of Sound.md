## Pressure Waves
- Molecules in the air are compressed and a rarefaction is created
- In its simplest form, sound can be represented as a sine wave
	- Sound is not actually a sine wave because the sound goes in all directions, but waveforms can be a helpful way to visualize sound waves

## Properties

| Perceptual Properties | Physical Properties |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Pitch                 | Frequency           |
| Volume                | Amplitude           |
| Timber                | Waveform & Spectrum |
| Articulation          | Amplitude Envelope  |
| Rhythm                | Transient Patterns  |
### Amplitude (volume)
- Decibels are logarithmic
	- $20dB$ is NOT twice as loud as $10dB$
### Transient Patterns
- The onset of the specific noise
- Usually the tall part marks the transient
#### Safe Limits
| decibels ($dB$) | Example                       | Exposure Limit |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| 10-50           | Quiet room                    | None           |
| 60              | Normal conversation           | 18 hrs         |
| 70              | Chamber orchestra             | 4.5 hrs        |
| 80              | Telephone dial tone           | 1.2 hrs        |
| 90              | Train whistle from $30m$ away | 18 minutes     |
| 100             | Jackhammer from $1m$ away     | 5 minutes      |
| 120+            | Auditory pain                 | 0 minutes      |
### Frequency
- The human hearing range at best is $20Hz - 20 kHz$
### Amplitude Envelope
- How the amplitude changes over time
- See [ADSR](ADSR.md)
### Movement
#### Transmission
- The sound traveling through a medium
- Needs to be adjusted appropriately depending on the medium to preserve sound quality
- Different mediums change sound waves
- The type of [audio cable](Cables.md) used affects signal transmission of sound
- [Transducers](Signal%20Flow.md#Transducers) convert sound waves between energy forms
