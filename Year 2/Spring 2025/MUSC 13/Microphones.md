## Polar Patterns 
- Directionality of sound capture
### Omnidirectional
- Picks up sound from all directions
### Cardioid
- Heart shape
- Most sensitive at top
- No sound on bottom
### Bidirectional
- More sensitive from the sides
- No sound on top and bottom
### Hyper cardioid
- More focused at top on V shape
- Some sound from bottom
### Super cardioid
- More focused on top
- More sound on bottom compared to hyper cardioid
## Types
### Dynamic
- Wire connected to diaphragm
- Other end of wire coiled on magnet
- Sturdier
- Less sensitive
- Often used for for live sound
- Sometimes used for studios to mic instruments
- Often used for higher SPLs (sound pressure levels)
	- Putting it in front of something with high SPL will be fine (e.g. putting it in front of a kick drum)
#### Ribbon Mics
- Super thin piece of metal as diaphragm
### Condenser
- Needs power (48 V  phantom power)
- More fragile
- More sensitive
- More common in studios as they are more sensitive
- Space between backplate and diaphragm
#### Boundary Microphone
- Good for surfaces
- Picks up overall sounds well
#### Phantom Power
- Power usually fed via cable
- Required for condenser mics
