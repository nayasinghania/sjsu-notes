>A mathematical system dealing with binary variables and logic operations
- Fundamental to digital logic design and circuit analysis
## Boolean Variables
- A boolean variable assumes two values TRUE or FALSE
	- TRUE is 1 and FALSE is 0
## Basic Operations
### AND (.) or conjunction (^)
### OR (+) or disjunction (v)
### NOT (') or negation ($\neg$)
- A unary operation which results in the exact opposite value of the present value
- $0^{'} = 1, 1^{'} = 0$
## Functions and Terms
- Each part of the right hand side of the equation is called a term
- Boolean functions can be represented with a truth table
## Logic Gates
>[!definition] 
>Electronic devices that perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output
### AND
- Fundamental for data validation and multiplexing
### OR
### NOT
### NAND
- NOT(AND)
### NOR
- NOT(OR)
### XOR
- EXCLUSIVE(OR)
### XNOR
- EXCLUSIVE(NOT(OR))
