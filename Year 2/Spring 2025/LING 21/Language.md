## Vagueness
>[!definition] 
>A word of phrase is vague when its meanning is fuzzy and inexact
- A vague word divides things into three classes
	- Those things to which the word clearly applies
	- Those things to which it clearly does not apply
	- Those things to which it may or may not apply
- Nearly all words are vague to some degree
- Varying level of vagueness
	- Precise - triangle, prime number
	- Moderately vague - vehicle
	- Extremely vague  - rich, obscene
>[!example]
>- The shoes were expensive
>- The parents and teachers spoke to each other. They were impressed
>- Is there a lot of homework for this class
>- Is the final exam going to be difficult
### Appropriateness of Vague Language
- It allows us to speak with suitable caution
- It frequently adds richness subtlety and complexity to poetry and other literary forms
- A certain deliberate vagueness may be needed to avoid disclosing important information and diplomacy
## Overgenerality
>[!definition] 
>Words are over general if the information they provide us too broad and unspecific in a given context

>[!example]
>- Where is Denmark located? Somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere
>- Who won the race? The fastest runner

Words can be overgeneral and vague
- Where are you going? Out. When will you be back? Later
## Ambiguity
>[!definition]
> A word expression is ambiguous if it has two or more distinct meanings and the context does not make clear which meaning is intended
- Some expressions are ambiguous because it is not clear to what a single word or phrase in the expression refers
>[!example]
>- I saw many stars (stars in the sky? celebrities?)
>- One morning he shot an elephant in pajamas (syntactical ambiguity)
>- I saw a five dollar bill walking down the street
### Semantic Ambiguities
>[!definition]
> Ambiguities that result from uncertainty about the meaning of an individual word or phrase
### Syntactical Ambiguities
>[!definition]
> Ambiguities that result from faulty grammar or word order
- Ambiguity due to sentence structure and/or word order
### Disputes
#### Verbal Dispute
>[!definition]
> Occurs when people appear to disagree on an issue but in actuality have simply not resolved the ambiguity of a key term
#### Factual Dispute
>[!definition] 
> Occurs when opponents disagree not over the meanings of words but over the relevant facts

## Importance of Precise Definitions
- In many discussions terms may need to be defined before a position can be advanced
## Types of Definitions
### Stipulative Definitions
>[!definition]
> Telling your readers or listeners what it is you mean by the term
### Persuasive Definitions
>[!definition] 
>Where an arguer defines a term in an effort to persuade a reader or listener to agree with the arguer's point of view
- Usually contains emotional appeals and slanted terms and topics
### Lexical Definitions

>[!definition]
>Intended to make a vague word more precise so that the word's meaning is not left to the interpretation of the reader or listener
## Emotive Language: Slanting the Truth
### The Emotive Power of Words
#### Denotation
>[!definition]
>The literal meaning of a word
- The emotive power of words can come from the word's denotation

>[!definition]

## Euphemisms and Political Correctness

### Euphemisms
>[!definition]
>Mild, comforting, or evasive words that take the place off harsh, blunt, or taboo words-
- Very often in our communications with one another, we avoid language that we feel might offend, upset, or insult our listeners or speakers
- A [critical thinker](Introduction%20to%20Critical%20Thinking.md) should be aware that pleasant or vague language is often used to hide reality or avoid facing the truth
