## Fallacies of Insufficient Evidence
>[!definition]
>Mistakes in reasoning that occur because the premises, though logically relevant to the conclusion, fail to provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.

### Inappropriate Appeal to Authority
>[!definition]
>When an arguer cites a witness or authority who, there is good reason to believe, is unreliable.
#### Types
##### Is the Source Not an Authority on the Subject at Issue?
>[!example]
>My barber told me that Einstein’s general theory of relativity is a lot of hogwash. I guess Einstein wasn’t as smart as everybody thinks he was.
###### Authority
>[!definition]
>A person who possesses special knowledge, competence, or expertise in a particular field.

##### Is the Source Biased?
>[!example]
>Mrs. Cox has testified that her son Willie was home with her at the time when Willie is alleged to have shot Steve Wilson. Even though Willie’s fingerprints were found on the murder weapon and six witnesses have identifi ed Willie as the assailant, I can’t believe that a good woman like Mrs. Cox would lie to protect her son. I think Willy is innocent.
##### Is the Accuracy of the Source’s Observations Questionable?
>[!example]
>After taking LSD and drinking seven beers, Jill claims she had a conversation with Elvis’s ghost in the alley behind McDearmon’s Bar. I’ve never known Jill to lie. So, I think we should believe her.
##### Is the Source Known to Be Generally Unreliable?
>[!example]
>Scientists’ Research Reveals . . . It Takes 3 Million Years for a Human Soul to Reach Heaven . . . And No One from Earth Has Arrived There Yet!
##### Has the Source Been Cited Incorrectly?
>[!example]
>It states in the Constitution that there must be a “wall of separation” between church and state. Publicly funded school vouchers clearly violate this wall of separation. Therefore, publicly funded school vouchers are unconstitutional.
##### Does the Source’s Claim Conflict with Expert Opinion?
>[!example]
>Dr. Duane Gish, a biochemist with a Ph.D. from Berkeley and former senior
>vice president of the Institute for Creation Research, has argued that there is no credible evidence supporting the theory of evolution. In view of Dr. Gish’s expertise on this subject, we should conclude that evolution is a myth.
##### Is the Source’s Claim Not One That Can Be Settled by an Appeal to Expert Opinion?
>[!example]
>Dr. Stanford P. Higginbotham, a leading social philosopher, has argued that capital punishment is always morally wrong. Given Dr. Higginbotham’s impressive credentials, we should conclude that capital punishment is always morally wrong.
##### Is the Claim Highly Improbable on Its Face?
>[!example]
>Old Doc Perkins says he has an eighty-year-old friend who can run a 100-yarddash in less than ten seconds. Old Doc is one of the most trusted members of this community. So, if Old Doc says he has an eighty-year-old friend who can run a 100-yard dash in less than ten seconds, I, for one, believe him.

### Appeal to Ignorance
>[!definition]
>When an arguer asserts that a claim must be true because no one has proven it false or, conversely, that a claim must be false because no one has proven it true.

>[!example]
>No one has proven that three-eyed, four-armed, polka-dotted gremlins don’t exist deep in the interior of the moon. Therefore, it’s reasonable to believe that such creatures do exist deep in the interior of the moon.
### False Alternatives
>[!definition]
>When an arguer poses a false either/or choice.

>[!example]
>Look, the choice is simple. Either you support a pure free-market economy or you support a communist police state. Surely you don’t support a communist police state. Therefore, you should support a pure free-market economy.
### Loaded Question
>[!definition]
>When an arguer asks a question that contains an unfair or unwarranted presupposition.

>[!example]
>Joe: Have you stopped cheating on exams?
>Pete: No!
>Joe: Oh, so you admit that you still cheat on exams?
>Pete: No, I meant to say yes!
>Joe: Oh, so you admit that you used to cheat on exams?
>Pete: No!
### Questionable Cause
>[!definition]
>When an arguer claims, without sufficient evidence, that one thing is the cause of something else.
#### Types
##### Post Hoc Fallacy
>[!definition]
>When an arguer assumes, without adequate evidence, that because one event, A, occurred before another event, B, A is the cause of B.

>[!example]
>How do I know that ginseng tea is a cure for the common cold? Last week I had a bad case of the sniffles. I drank a cup of ginseng tea, and the next morning my sniffles were gone.
##### Mere Correlation Fallacy
>[!definition]
>When an arguer assumes, without sufficient evidence, that because A and B regularly occur together, A must be the cause of B or vice versa.

>[!example]
>Aztec high priest: Every spring we sacrifice a virgin to the sun god, and every summer the life-giving rains come. Therefore, sacrificing a virgin to the sun god causes the life-giving rains to come.
##### Oversimplified Cause Fallacy
>[!definition]
>When we assume, without adequate evidence, that A is the sole cause of B when, in fact, there are several causes of B.

>[!example]
>SAT scores have fallen sharply since the 1960s. Clearly, students are watching too much TV
### Hasty Generalization
>[!definition]
>When we draw a general conclusion from a sample that is biased or too small.

>[!example]
>Small-business owner: I’ve hired three San Pedrans in the past six months, and all three were lazy and shiftless. I guess most San Pedrans are lazy and shiftless.
### Slippery Slope
>[!definition]
>When we claim, without sufficient evidence, that a seemingly harmless action, if taken, will lead to a disastrous outcome.

>[!example]
>Bans on so-called assault weapons must be vigorously opposed. Once the gun-grabbing liberals have outlawed assault weapons, next they’ll go after handguns. After that, it will be shotguns and semiautomatic hunting rifles. In the end, law-abiding citizens will be left totally defenseless against predatory criminals and a tyrannical government.
#### Pattern
1. The arguer claims that if a certain seemingly harmless action, A, is permitted, A will lead to B, B will lead to C, and so on to D.
2. The arguer holds that D is a terrible thing and therefore should not be permitted.
3. In fact, there is no good reason to believe that A will actually lead to D.
### Weak Analogy
>[!definition]
>When an arguer compares two (or more) things that aren’t really comparable in relevant respects.

>[!example]
> Lettuce is leafy and green and tastes great with a veggie burger. Poison ivy is also leafy and green. Therefore, poison ivy probably tastes great with a veggie burger, too.
#### Pattern
##### 1
1. A has characteristics w, x, y, and z.
2. B has characteristics w, x, and y.
3. Therefore, B probably has characteristic z too.
##### 2
1. A is an x, and A is a y.
2. B is an x, and B is a y.
3. C is an x, and C is a y.
4. D is an x.
5. Therefore, D is probably a y too.
### Inconsistency
>[!definition]
>When an arguer asserts inconsistent or contradictory claims.

>[!example]
>Moral relativist: Hey, get with the times, man! All value judgments are relative. And that’s the absolute truth.
