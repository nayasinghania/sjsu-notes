## Syllogism
>[!definition]
>An argument that consists of exactly two premises and a conclusion
## Deduction and Induction
- Arguments differ greatly in the amount of support they claim to provide
### Deductive Arguments
>[!definition]
>Tries to prove conclusions with rigorous, inescapable logic
#### Patterns
##### Hypothetical Syllogism
- Contains at least one hypothetical or conditional
###### Examples
- If the Tigers beat the Yankees, then the Tigers will make the playoffs.
- The Tigers will beat the Yankees.
- So, the Tigers will make the playoffs.
###### Modus Ponens (valid)
- If A then B
- A
- Therefore, B
###### Chain Arguments (valid)
- If A then B
- If B then C
- Therefore, if A then C
###### Modus Tollens (valid)
- If A then B
- Not B
- Therefore, not A
###### Denying the Antecedent (invalid)
- If A then B
- Not A
- Therefore, not B
###### Affirming the consequent (invalid)
- If A then B
- B
- Therefore, A
##### Categorical Syllogism
- Each statement begins with the word *all*, *some*, or *no*
##### Argument by Elimination
- Seeks to logically rule out various possibilities until only a single possibility remains
###### Examples
- Either Joe walked to the library or he drove
- But Joe didn’t drive to the library
- Therefore, Joe walked to the library
##### Argument Based on Mathematics
- Conclusion is claimed to depend largely on mathematical calculations or measurements
###### Examples
- Eight is greater than four
- Four is greater than two
- Therefore, eight is greater than two
##### Argument from Definition
- True by definition
###### Examples
- Janelle is a cardiologist
	- Therefore, Janelle is a doctor
- Bertha is an aunt
	- It follows that she is a woman
#### Examples
- All humans are mortal
- Socrates is human
- Therefore, Socrates is moral
#### Deductive Validity
- When it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false, the argument is valid
- Must have these conditions
	- If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true
	- The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises
	- The premises provide logically conclusive grounds for the truth of the conclusion
	- It is logically inconsistent to assert all the premises as true and deny the conclusion
##### Sound Deductive Arguments
- Both valid and true
##### Invalid Deductive Arguments
- The conclusion does not follow neccesarily from the premises
### Inductive Arguments
>[!definition]
>Tries to show that that conclusions are plausible or likely given the premise
#### Patterns
##### Inductive Generalization
- Argument in which a generalization is claimed to be probably true based on information about some members of a particular class
##### Predictive Argument
- A prediction is defended with reasons
##### Argument from Authority
- Asserts a claim and then supports that claim by citing some presumed authority or witness who has said that the claim is true
##### Causal Argument
- Asserts or denies that something is the cause of something else
##### Statistical Argument
- Rests on statistical evidence
##### Argument from Analogy 
- Conclusion if claimed to depend on an analogy
#### Inductive Strength
##### Weak Inductive Argument
- The conclusion does *not* follow probably from the premises
##### Strong
###### Cogent
- If an argument both is inductively strong and all true premises
###### Uncogent
- If an inductive argument either is weak or has at least one false premise
#### Examples
- Every ruby so far discovered has been red
- So, probably all rubies are red
### Tests
#### Indicator Word Test
##### Deduction Words
- Certainly
- Absolutely
- Conclusively
##### Induction Words
- Probably
- Likely
- It is plausible to suppose that
- It is reasonable to assume that
#### Strict Necessity Test
- An argument’s conclusion either follows with strict logical necessity from its premises or it does not. 
- If the argument’s conclusion does follow with strict logical necessity from its premises, the argument should always be treated as deductive.
- If the argument’s conclusion does not follow with strict logical necessity from its premises, the argument should normally be treated as inductive.
##### Exceptions (either or)
1. The language or context makes clear that the arguer intended to offer a logically conclusive argument, but the argument, in fact, is not logically conclusive;
2. The argument has a pattern of reasoning that is characteristically deductive, and nothing else about the argument indicates clearly that the argument is meant to be inductive
#### Common Pattern Test
##### Deduction
- If  *first statement* is true, then *second statement* is true
- If A then B
	- A
		- Therefore, B
