energy - capability to do work

work - ability to transfer energy

  

3 forms of energy

solar - 

chemical - 

mechanical - 

  

a basic character of a living organism is the ability to acquire and use energy

  

laws of thermodynamics

1st law - energy may be converted between two forms

2nd law - conversion of energy between forms results in the loss of energy evidenced as heat

– if the conversion is happening in an isolated system the degree of disorder always increases

entropy - amount of disorder in a system

  

cells: example of an isolated system

how do cells maintain order? through a constant input of energy

ATP - adenosine triphosphate

ATP is a nucleic acid containing three phosphate groups 

  

adenine–ribose–phosphate-phosphate-phosphate

  

ribose - sugar

pops one phosphate off

adenosine biphosphate (like an uncharged battery)

“currency” restored when phosphate is added

  

cells use energy from chemical bonds found in organic nutrient

  

different structures of chemical bonds

  

carbohydrates (fancy word for sugars)

proteins

nucleic acids

fats

  

what differentiates macromolecules

functional groups: special combination of atoms

they provide chemical reactivity to certain chains

  

organic macromolecules

-long chains of smaller molecules

smaller molecules are referred to as monomers

longer chains are referred to as polymers

  

sugar - polysaccharide 

amino acid - protein

nucleotide - nucleic acid

  

-monomers have a hydroxyl group at several locations along the hydrocarbon

-to link two monomers the hydroxyl group can be removed from one monomer and a hydrogen from the other to form water

-(referred to as dehydration)

  

hydroxyls go away, monomer becomes polymer with water molecules attached

  

hydrolysis

breaks down polymers

monomer – OH   HO – monomer – OH

  

carbs - bread, pasta, cereals

lipids - oils, butter

protein - beans, meat, milk

  

carbohydrates

-can be used quickly as an energy source

-lots of hydroxyl groups makes it hydrophilic (water soluble)

-body is mostly water so carbs get everywhere in the body

  

monosaccharides - single carb units, sometimes called simple sugars - glucose, galatose, fructose

  

disaccharides - combinations of two monosaccharides, one of which is usually glucose - maltose, lactose, sucrose

  

polysaccharides - long chains of glucose molecules, may be either branched or unbranched - starch, glycogen, fiber

  

our bodies store glucose in the polysaccharide form of glycogen

  

fiber slows down digestive tract (the whole system slow down)

  

gluten - a protein found naturally in cereal grains like rye, barley, and wheat

  

celiac disease is an autoimmune response in the small intestine caused by the presence of gluten that results in the damage of the lining of the intestine

  

lipids

- used for long term storage
    
- lipids are hydrophobic
    
- triglycerides-a single glycerol unit attached to three fatty acid chains of varying length-energy storage
    
- cholesterol-carbons arranged in a ring like structure-cell membrane function and hormone production 
    
- phospholipids-triglyceride modified to contain a phosphate group in place of one of the fatty acid chains-structure of the cell membrane
    

fats are from animals, oils are from plants

  

triglycerides: three fatty acid chains stored as an energy reserve through a linkage to glycerol

-fatty acid chains are long hydrocarbons that can vary in width and structure

-a glycerol unit is basically half of glucose

  

saturated fatty acids have single bonds (a solid structure), and this is worse because it can lead to heart issues and cardiovascular problems

  

unsaturated fatty acids have double bonds in their hydrocarbon tail, and have a bend in the structure

  

trans fats have no bend (similar to unsaturated fats but has no bend) 

- usually found in processed foods
    

  

proteins

-have many various functions in our body

–enzymes are proteins

–proteins can be signaling molecules 

-can also be used as an energy source

  

20 different amino acids - they are all hydrocarbons (central carbon) bound to hydrogen

  

protein structure

-primary: sequence of amino acids in the chain

-secondary: weak bonds, alpha helix or pleated sheet

-tertiary: when the groups from the different amino acids interact with each other, globular shape

-quaternary: more than one polypeptide

- Started with an ancestral cell that became eukaryotic, then the cell got hungry and “ate” a bacteria which allowed the ancestral cell to use oxygen to make energy due to having the bacteria and got another membrane from the ancestral cell
    

- Plasma membrane
    

- Separates inside and outside of the cell
