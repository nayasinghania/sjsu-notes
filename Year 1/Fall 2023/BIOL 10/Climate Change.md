Global warming

- Increase in average global temperatures since the 1980s
    
- Many factors determine Earth’s average temp
    

- Was challenging to determine a baseline average
    
- Amt of radiation from the sun is determined by the sun cycle (11 years)
    
- Planet activity influences the average temp over time
    

- Planet activity = volcanic eruptions
    

- Rate is accelerating
    

  

Causes of climate change

- Greenhouse gases
    

- Gases in our atmosphere trap heat near the Earth’s surface
    
- Some of these are essential to life
    

- Making the Earth warm enough for living organisms
    

- Greenhouse effect
    

- Solar energy strikes Earth
    

- Some reflected back into space (deflected by ice and snow)
    
- Majority strikes oceans and darker covered planet portions
    

- Solar energy absorbed and gradually released back into the atmosphere as heat
    

- Water and CO2 trap some of this energy and re-release it slowly back into the atmosphere
    
- We do not need large amounts of GHGs to achieve this
    

- Temperatures in the lower atmosphere and on the Earth’s surface are affected the most due to large amounts of GHGs
    

- CO2
    

- Produced through natural events
    

- Fires, volcanic activity, cellular respiration
    

- One of the most important GHGs
    
- Causes of increases
    

- Increases in fossil fuels (oil and coal)
    
- Changes in agricultural practices
    
- Deforestation
    
- Natural causes = forest fires, volcanoes
    

- Methane
    

- Naturally produced from decomposition of organic matter
    
- Powerful GHG able to retain/release 30x amt of heat
    
- Causes of increases
    

- Increase in livestock which produce methane
    
- Increase in production of agricultural products like rice which release methane
    
- Landfill size increase

Evidence of climate change

- Oceans
    

- CO2 dissolves easily in water and interacts with H2O by forming H2CO3
    
- Carbonic acid increases the hydrogen ions in the water
    
- An increase in H+ ions decreases the pH (acidic ocean)
    

- Decrease carbonate CO3
    
- Carbonate is used by sea creatures to make their shells
    
- Less carbonate = less carbs, lobsters, and clams
    
- Drastically affects the ecosystem
    

- Surface temperatures increasing
    
- Water acts as a heat sink (temp storage of heat energy)
    

- Glaciers and sea ice
    

- Glaciers decreasing
    
- Ice sheets decreasing
    

- Greenland loses 270 gigatons of ice per year
    
- Antarctica loses 150 gigatons of ice per year
    
- 1 gigaton can fill over 400,000 Olympic-sized pools
    

- The Arctic ice cap
    

- Vulnerable to changes in global temperatures due to location over open water
    

- Extreme weather events
    

- Includes droughts, heat waves, extreme precipitation events
    

- Unclear if tornadoes are connected to climate change
    

- Influenced by an increase in global temperatures

The Carbon Cycle

  

Both CO2 and methane contain carbon. This is the same carbon that is found in the organic nutrients we eat

  

Carbon: an element

- The nucleus of an element contains protons and neutrons
    

- Protons: positively charged subatomic particles
    
- Neutrons: neutrally charged subatomic particles
    

- Atomic # = # of protons in an atom
    
- Atomic mass = # of protons + # of neutrons in an atom
    
- Electrons are located in electron shells
    

- Negatively charged particles that have almost no mass
    
- # of electrons = # of protons
    

- Electrons determine the chemical reactivity of an element
    

  

Chemical reactivity

- Electrons determine the chemical reactivity of an element
    
- Electrons in the outer shell interact with atoms of other elements to form chemical bonds
    
- Carbon prefers to form 4 chemical bonds at a time
    

  

Electron shell of carbon

- The inner shell has space for 2 electrons
    
- All other shells have space for 8 electrons
    
- Carbon has space for 4 electrons
    

  

Chemical bonds

- Ionic
    

- donate/accept electrons
    

- Covalent
    

- Share electrons
    

  

Carbon cycle

- Carbon cycle between abiotic geologic and atmospheric reservoirs and biotic organisms
    
- Carbon is found in the oceans, underground in fossil fuels, and the atmosphere
    

- Carbon sinks
    
- Reservoir for long-term storage
    

- Animals release CO2 into the atmosphere during cellular respiration via the breakdown of organic nutrients for energy
    

- Carbon source
    

  

Photosynthesis

- Series of chemical metabolic reactions used by plants to produce their own food
    
- The majority of photosynthesis occurs in the leaves
    
- Mesophyll cells house the cellular machinery for photosynthesis
    

- Chloroplasts: organelle responsible for chemical reactions
    
- Thykaloids: disc-like structures containing chlorophyll (a pigment)
    
- Grana: stacks of thylakoids
    
- Stroma: space between grana stacks of thylakoids
    

  

Solar energy strikes the planet as photons traveling at different wavelengths

  

Sunlight has both a wave and a particle nature

  

Photosynthesis organisms use only a small portion of the EM spectrum referred to as visible light

  

Photosynthesis

- light-dependent reactions
    

- Captures energy from the sun and transfers it to ATP and NADPH
    
- Occurs in the thylakoid of the chloroplasts
    
- Uses the photosynthetic pigments
    

- light-independent reactions 
    

- Uses energy from light-dependent reactions to convert CO2 into carbohydrates
    
- Occurs within the stroma of the chloroplast
    
- Also called the Calvin cycle
    

  

Light-dependent reactions

- Chlorophyll absorbs energy from the sun
    

- Energizes electrons forming high-energy particles
    
- Found in the photosystems (I and II) of the thylakoid
    

- Electrons are passed to a series of proteins on the thylakoid membrane
    

- Electron transport chain which produces an H+ gradient
    
- NADP reductase which transfers electrons to NADP+ to produce NADPH
    

- Electrons lost are replaced by photolysis
    

- Water is broken down, releasing electrons, hydrogen ions, and oxygen
    

- Some of the high-energy electrons are used to produce ATP
    
- NADP+ accepts some high-energy electrons to produce NADPH
    

  

Light-independent reactions

- ATP and NADPH fuel Calvin cycle reactions
    
- Uses CO2 to produce Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)
    
- 3 steps
    

- Carbon fixation
    
- Electrons from NADPH and ATP are used to reduce CO2
    
- Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate is regenerated
    

- The remaining 1 molecule of G3P from the 3 turns of the Calvin cycle is used to make carbohydrates
    

- Requires 6 turns of the Calvin cycle
    

- ADP and NADP+ are returned to the light-dependent reactions
    

  

Fossil fuels

- Fuel sources formed in the earth from plant and animal remains
    

- Includes oil, natural gas, coal, and shale
    
- Methane is a large component of natural gas
    

- Formed by submerging organic material over long periods of time and subjecting them to the heat and pressure of Earth’s crust
    

  

Formation of coal

- Plants and animals lived in swampy ecosystems
    
- As the organisms died, they became covered by the low-oxygen environment of the swamp preventing their decay
    
- Over time, they were covered by dirt and exposed to intense pressure and heat forming coal
    
- Remains of organic material
    
- Burning of fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere
    
- The US produces ~79% of its energy from fossil fuels
    

  

Until the late 19th century, fossil fuels were only released slowly into the atmosphere
