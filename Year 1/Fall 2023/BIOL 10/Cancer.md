Cancer

- 2nd leading cause of death in the US
    
- 4th leading cause of death in young adults
    
- TABLE 1.1 Some Common Forms of Cancer
    
- 1 in 2 males develop cancer
    
- 1 in 3 females develop cancer
    
- Mortality rates have decreased by 21%
    

  

Cancer cells

- Abnormal forms of the body’s own cells that multiply uncontrollably
    

- Due to altered genetic content, normal control mechanisms are disrupted in cancer cells
    
- Genetic disease
    

- Cancer cells ignore their genetic programming and become less specialized
    

  

Cells

- TABLE 1.2 Functions of Some Common Structures in a Human Cell
    
- 30 trillion cells
    
- As the cell divides, signals from nearby cells instruct the cell to turn off certain sets of instructions in the DNA and turn on others
    

- Results in specialized cells
    

- Acquire materials to manufacture energy and materials for transport
    

- Work performed by enzymes
    

  

Enzymes 

- Form an assembly line to produce a particular product
    
- The product of the enzymes upstream is the substrate of the enzymes downstream
    

  

A change n the DNA can alter the shape and thus the function of a protein

- This alteration can cause a cell to become cancerous
    

  

Cell division

- Interphase
    

- Cell performs normal functions but also prepare for M phase
    
- G1 phase
    

- First growth phase
    

- S phase
    

- DNA is replicated or synthesized
    

- G2 phase
    

- Second growth phase
    

- Cells that don’t actively divided enter the G0 phase (resting phase)
    
- Checkpoints
    

- Ensures DNA is ready for cell division
    
- G1 assesses DNA integrity
    
- G2 assesses copying of DNA (was it done correctly)
    
- M phase checkpoint assesses if DNA was separated correctly
    
- If the checkpoints don't work properly the cell may become cancerous
    

- M phase
    

- Cell division occurs here
    
- Mitosis
    
- cytokinesis
    

- Not all cells go through the cell cycle at the same rate
    

  

Telomeres

- Repetitive nucleotides
    
- Each time the cell goes through the cell cycle the telomeres shorten
    
- Length can determine age cells
    
- When telomeres get too short the cell is targeted for destruction
    

  

Continually dividing cells

- S phase
    

- DNA replication occurs
    
- Each homologous chromosome is copied
    
- Produces an identical structure = sister chromatids
    
- Sister chromatids held together by centromere
    
- Centrosomes are replicated
    

  

Mutations

- Silent mutations
    

- No mutation
    
- His -> His
    

- Missense mutation
    

- Glu -> Val
    

- Nonsense mutation
    

- Glu -> Stop
    

  

Cell cycle regulation genes

- tumor-suppressor genes
    

- Prevent unregulated cell growth
    
- Slow progression of cell in cell cycle
    
- Both copies of the genes need to be mutated to cause cancer
    
- Examples
    

- Proteins that examine the DNA for damage during the G1 checkpoint
    
- P53
    
- BRCA1
    
- Rb
    

- Proto-oncogenes
    

- Precursor to a gene that is associated with cancer
    
- Accelerate cell cycle
    
- Proteins are involved in signaling pathways that promote growth and cellular development
    

- External growth factor binds to a receptor initiating a signaling pathway that causes cell growth
    

- Become an oncogene when a mutation causes it to be actives without the influence of the external growth factor
    
- Only need one copy of the gene to be defective for cells to become cancerous
    
- Specific example
    

- ERBB2 gene that produces the protein HER-2 (a receptor that assists in the growth of breast tissue
    
- 25% of all breast cancers have a mutation that causes an overexpression of HER-2 protein

Cancer

- Cellular disease
    

- Starts with a single cell that divides over and over again continuously
    

- Genetic disease
    

- Mutations disrupt normal cell cycle control mechanisms
    
- Over time more and more mutations are acquired
    

  

Identifying cancer cells

- Abnormal forms of the body’s own cells that multiply continuously uncontrollably
    

  

Characteristics of cancer cells

- Different appearance
    

- Irregular shape
    
- Dysplasia
    

- Nuclei are typically larger, have an irregular shape and are darker
    

- Due to the increased amount of DNA in the nucleus
    

- Immortal
    

- Telomerase repairs the end of chromosomes
    

- Less specialized
    

- Genetic programming is reversed
    
- Originally set of genes are turned on while others are turned off
    
- Loss of specialization = abnormal shape
    

- They steal the nutrients the need to grow
    
- No longer functions as part of the surrounding tissue
    
- If the cancer cells continue to divided a mass of unspecialized tissue will form
    

- This is called a tumor
    

- Benign tumor
    

- Localized to one tissue type
    
- Cells often closely resemle those in the surrounding tissue
    
- Less dangerous
    

- Malignant tumor
    

- Has the ability to invade other tissues or organs and move to other locations in the body
    
- Cells do not resemble other cells of the tissue
    
- Cells are very unspecialized
    
- Cells within the tumor are diverse in appearance
    
- Most dangerous form
    

  

Angiogenesis

- Cells in the middle of the tumor release growth factors
    

- Causes the local capillaries to grow towards the tumor and deliver oxygen and nutrients
    

- These capillaries can then move cancer cells from their original location to another location in the body
    

- Cancer cells can also move through lymphatic vessels
    
- Cancer releases proteinase at the new site
    

  

Metastasis

- Malignant tumor
    
- Distant tumor
    

  

Stages of cancer

- How large is the tumor
    
- Has the tumor spread / invaded other tissues
    
- Is the cancer in nearby lymph nodes
    
- Has the cancer moved to other organs
    
- Stage 0
    

- Early detection
    
- Cancer cells are located in a small area
    
- Cells have not begun to invade any surrounding tissue
    

- More than one tissue in one organ
    

- Stage 1
    

- Cancer  cells have begun to invade surrounding tissue
    

- 1A: tumor is small, less than 2cm
    
- 1B:  tumor is smaller than 2cm
    

- Stage 2
    

- Cancer cells are considered invasive
    
- Tumor is large but still inside of the one organ
    

- 2A: tumor is smaller than 2 cm and found in multiple lymph nodes
    
- 2B: tumor is between 2 - 5 cm and found in lymph nodes
    

- Stage 3
    

- Cancer cells are more invasive
    

- Breast tissue affected
    
- Surrounding tissues are affected
    

- Not yet spread to distant tissues or organs
    

- 3A: less than 2 cm and spread to more than 4 lymph nodes
    
- Larger than 5c and spread to only nearby lymph nodes
    

- 3B: tumor spread to the wall of the organ and 9 lymph nodes
    
- 3C: tumor has spread to nearby bones or more than 10 lymph nodes
    

- Stage 4
    

- Cancer has fully metastasized and spread to outside organs
    
- For breast cancer this includes spreading to the lungs, heart, brain, and liver
    
- This stage is considered incurable
    

- Medical advances are being made to extend the life of individuals with stage 4 cancer
    

  

TMN Classification of cancer

- Second classification used by pathologists
    
- T = size of the tumor
    

- T1 < T2 < T3 < T4
    

- N = number of lymph nodes cancer is detected
    

- N3 = cancer cells found in 3 lymph nodes
    

- M = metastasis of cancer
    

- M0 = no metastasis
    
- M1 = cancer has moved to distant organs or tissues
    

  

Cancer causes death by disrupting our physiology

- Tumors take up space in organ
    
- Tumors take nutrients and oxygen from healthy cells
    
- Tumors alter body chemistry
    
- Homeostasis
    

- Maintenance of a stable environment
    

- Internal temp is 37 C
    
- Internal pH is set at 7.4
    

- Optimal environment for our enzymes
    
- Dynamic steady state in which changes that occur are minimized by compensatory physiological responses
    
- Control systems
    

- Negative feedback mechanism
    
- Restores homeostasis by reducing the stimulus at the start
    

- Disrupted by homeostasis
