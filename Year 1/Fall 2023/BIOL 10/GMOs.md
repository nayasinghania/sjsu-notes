Basic plant characteristics

- Multicellular
    

- All plants are composed of cells arranged into more complex tissues and organ systems
    

- Eukaryotes
    

- Plant cells contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles
    

- Photosynthetic
    

- Plants are autotrophs
    

- Autotrophs have the ability to make their own food
    

- Plants use sunlight as their source of energy and CO2 as their carbon source
    

  

Evolution of plants

- Charophytes = green freshwater algae
    
- Once plants left the aquatic environment they had to adapt
    

- Prevent drying out
    
- Develop a way to transport water and nutrients to all of their cells
    
- Change how they disperse their gametes in the absence of water
    
- Protect embryos from the temperature
    

- Mosses
    

- Primitive, no vascular system, restricted to moist environments
    
- First to have embryo protection
    

- Lycophytes
    

- First plants 
    

- Ferns
    

- Large leaves (megaphylls) increase surface area for photosynthesis
    

- Gymnosperms
    

- First plants to develop seeds
    

- Angiosperms
    

- Developed an alternative reproductive structure, the flower
    

  

Phylogeny

- Shows all major adaptive events
    

  

Life cycle of a plant

- Both the sporophyte and gametophyte stages are present in an individual plant
    

- Sporophyte stage is responsible for photosynthesis
    

- Meiosis reduces the chromosome number
    
- But mitosis produces the gametes in plants
    

  

Life cycle of an angiosperm

- Flower = sporophyte reproductive structure
    
- Pollen grains and embryo sacs  = gametophyte reproductive cells
    

- Anther produces pollen grains
    
- Select cells in the ovary become the egg and embryo sac
    

- Pollen grain reaches the ovule with the help of a pollinator
    

- Germinates to release haploid sperm
    

- Pollen grain contain two sperm
    

- One unites with the egg to produce a diploid embryo
    
- Second unites with a diploid cell in the ovary to produce the endosperm (3n)
    

- Diploid embryo is enclosed in a seed
    

- Endosperm is used as a food source for the developing embryo
    

  

Photosynthesis

- Series of chemical metabolic reactions used by plants to produce their own food
    
- Majority of photosynthesis occurs in the leaves
    
- Mesophyll cells house the cellular machinery for photosynthesis
    

- Chloroplasts: organelle responsible for chemical reactions
    
- Thylakoids: disc-like structures containing chlorophyll (a pigment)
    
- Grana: stacks of thylakoids
    
- Stroma: space between the grana stacks of thylakoids
    

- Two stages
    

- Light-dependent reactions
    

- Captures energy from the sun and transfers it to ATP and NADPH
    
- NADPH carries high-energy electrons
    

- Light-independent reactions
    

- Synthesize carbohydrates
    
- Occurs within the stroma of the chloroplast
    
- Uses energy from light-dependent reactions to convert CO2 into carbohydrates
    
- Also called the Calvin cycle
    

- CO2 is added to a 5-carbon molecule (RuBP)
    
- 6 carbon molecule produced is unstable
    

- Split into 3-phosphoglycerate
    

- Converted into 2 molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
    

- Uses ATP and NADPH
    

- Some glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules are combined to form glucose
    

- Others reused in the Calvin cycle
    

- Several turns of the cycle are needed to produce glucose
    

- Products
    

- Oxygen
    
- Carbohydrates
    

- Fruits, vegetables, grains
    

- Oils
    

- Energy source

- Chemical compounds
    

- Tannins, alkaloids, phenols
    

- Table 2.1
    

  

Why should we genetically modify plants?

- Solution to food waste
    

- Improves fruit ripening
    

- Fresh produce ripens and spoils quickly
    

- Once they are spoiled we throw them away
    

- Historical solution: crops picked before they are ripe and then exposed to a plant hormone (ethylene) when at destination
    
- Browning is caused by polyphenols
    
- Polyphenol oxidase catalyzes a reaction between polyphenols and oxygen causing the fruit to brown
    

- Gene that produces the enzyme in fruit can be turned off
    
- Example: arctic apple
    

- RNA interference
    

- Small pieces of RNA are introduced into the cells
    
- RNA finds a complementary strand on the mRNA
    
- Double-stranded RNA is targeted for destruction
    
- Translation does not occur
    
- Protein is not mad
    

- Solution to growing population
    

- Farmland is finite
    
- Need to increase the amount of food produced per acre
    

- Increases crop yield
    

- Yield is generally increased by preventing loss
    
- Predation from insects decreased
    

- Insertion of Bacillus thurignesis (Bt) endotoxin gene
    

- Competition from weeds
    

- RoundUp (glyphosate) inhibits the enzyme EPSPS
    
- EPSPS produces amino acids and vitamins for plant growth
    
- Plants can become resistant to glyphosate via insertion of genes from bacteria or by the insertion of genes that produce an enzyme that breaks down glyphosate
    

- Increase yield per acre by up to 25%
    

- Increase health outcomes
    

- Plants can also be modified to produce more of a compound
    

- Canole plants produce more specific fatty acids in their oils
    

- Solution to nutrient deficiencies
    

- Produces more nutritious foods
    

- 600,000 children die each year due to vitamin A deficiency 
    
- Solution = golden rice
    
- Beta-carotene is a precursor of vitamin A
    

- Not naturally found in rice
    

- Two genes (daffodil and soil bacterium gene) inserted into rice

How do we genetically modify a plant?

1. Identify the gene to modify
    
2. Find the gene in the genome
    
3. Make several copies of the gene
    
4. Modify the gene
    
5. Insert it into the plant
    

  

Proteins

- Responsible for all cell activities
    

- Processing energy and materials

- A laser identifies the dye at each location
    

1. DNA polymerase and a primer are added to the DNA sample
    
2. Fluorescent-labeled nucleotides are added
    

3. When added the replication reaction is halted

Gene cloning

1. PPO gene extracted from a cell
    
2. PPO gene is inserted into a bacterial plasmid
    

3. Circular plasmid DNA is cut open with a restriction enzyme
    
4. PPO gene is inserted with the help of DNA ligase
    

5. Recombinant DNA is inserted into a bacteria host cell
    

6. Recombinant DNA: DNA not found naturally in the environment
    

7. The cell produces multiple copies of the gene product
    

8. Copies are referred to as clones

- Primer = small synthetic complementary DNA piece
    

- Extension (72 C)
    

- Optimal temp for DNA polymerase to add complementary nucleotides to single strands
    
- DNA polymerase comes from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus found in hot springs
    

  

Mutagenesis

- Mutation: natural product of DNA replication
    

- DNA polymerase occasionally makes error during DNA replication process
    

- Can be manipulated to make purposeful changes in the DNA

First FDA-approved GMO

- Flavr-savr made by Calgene in 1994
    
- Gene that dissolves pectin in tomato skin disabled
    
- Solution to food waste
    
- Remove from market due to public opposition (made it unprofitable)
    

  

GMO concerns

- Horizontal gene transfer: transfer of genes between species
    

- Common natural occurrence
    
- Bacteria routinely share genes between species
    
- Viruses routinely insert their genes into our genomes
    
- What is glyphosate-resistant gene in the crop is transferred to the weeds
    

- Insecticide-resistant weeds have been found
    
- Genetic analysis shows that this is mostly due to natural selection as a result of the widespread use of glyphosate and not gene transfer
    

- Adverse human reactions
    

- Starlink corn
    

- GMO corn with gene for insecticide resistance and pesticide resistance
    
- Pesticide resistance due to Bacillus thuringiensis
    
- Approved for use in animal feed in May 1998
    
- Was in the process of proving that Cry9C was not allergenic in order to get approval for human consumption
    

- One would have to already be allergic to the product being inserted
    

- It is virtually impossible to have a food allergy to a protein that is new to the human diet
    

- Impact on non-pest species
    

- Meta-analyses on non-target species generally do not appear to be impacted
    

  

Why do we need GM plants?

- Climate change
    

- Wheat with increased photosynthesis in CO2-rich environments
    
- Rice modified to survive high salt environments
    
- Drought-resistant corn and soybean
    
- Goal: grow more food on less land using less water and fewer chemical insecticides
    

- Pest management
    
- Growing population
