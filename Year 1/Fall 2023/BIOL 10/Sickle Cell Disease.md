Genetic disease

- Caused by inherited change (mutation) in the genetic information
    
- Passed on from generation to generation
    

  

Gene

- Basic unit of inheritance
    
- Segment of DNA that contains information to make a protein or RNA molecule
    

  

Sickle cell disease

- Sickle cell anemia
    
- Caused by one change in the hemoglobin gene
    

- Changes the shape of hemoglobin
    
- Prevents hemoglobin from transporting oxygen to your tissues
    

- Causes red blood cells to have a sickle shape
    
- Inheritance pattern is well-established
    

  

Hemoglobin

- Protein that carries oxygen
    
- Consists of four polypeptide chains
    

- Two alpha and two beta globin chains
    

- Each chain contains a heme group (Fe)
    

  

Red blood cells

- Primary function = oxygen transport
    
- Don't have a nucleus
    
- 250 million hemoglobin molecules
    
- Biconcave disc-shaped
    

  

Oxygen transport

- Gases move down a concentration gradient
    
- External respiration
    

- After inspiration, the partial pressure of oxygen is greater in the lungs than in the blood
    
- Oxygen diffuses into the blood and is picked up by hemoglobin to form oxyhemoglobin
    
- Hb + O2 -> HbO2
    

- Internal respiration
    

- At the tissues, the partial pressure of oxygen is less than the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood
    
- Oxygen diffuses into the tissue in exchange for carbon dioxide
    

  

Carbon dioxide transport

- Hemoglobin doesn't bind to carbon dioxide very well
    
- Carbon dioxide is converted inside of the red blood cell to carbonic acid (H2CO3)
    
- Carbonic anhydrase converts H2CO3 back into carbon dioxide
    
- H+ + HCO3- -> H2CO3 -> H2O + CO2
    

  

Effects of sickle cell disease on the body

- Circulatory system
    

- Role
    

- Deliver oxygen and nutrients to the cells
    
- Remove cellular waste 
    

- Oxygen transport is inefficient
    

- Anemia develops
    

- Sickle-shaped RBCs become sticky and clump together
    

- Block a capillary
    
- Prevents blood flow
    

- Respiratory system
    

- Role
    

- Gas exchange
    

- Sickle-shaped RBCs become sticky and clump together
    

- Block a capillary near the alveoli
    
- Prevent gas exchange
    
- Result = acute chest syndrome
    

- Acute chest syndrome accelerates anemia
    

- Results in a sickle crisis
    

- Entire body
    

- Blocked capillaries can yield pain anywhere in the body
    

- Pain most noticeable in the joints
    

- Spleen becomes enlarged
    

- Site of red blood cell recycling
    
- Can cause abdominal pain
    

- Blocked capillaries in the kidney can prevent blood filtration
    

- Evidence as blood in the urine
    

- Reduced blood flow increases susceptibility to infections
    

- Immune cells use the circulatory system to reach pathogens
    

  

Heterozygous advantage

- Homozygous dominant have symptoms
    
- Heterozygous can be carriers
    

- Not affected by malaria
    
- Have an advantage over homozygous recessive

Storytime

- 1928: Frederick Griffith
    

- Attempt to create a pneumonia vaccine
    
- Two strains of pneumonia
    

- R strain didn't cause sickness
    
- S strain was virulent and smooth appearance
    

- The S strain was doing something to the R strain to make it virulent
    

- Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, someone else
    

- Took heat-inactivated virulent strain, and added protease, RNAse, or DNAse (remove protein, RNA, or DNA)
    
- Then combined with R strain
    
- Protease became virulent
    
- RNAse became virulent
    
- DNAse did not change
    

- Hershey and chase
    

- Used radioisotopes and bacteriophage
    

- Bacteriophage
    

- Virus that infects bacteria
    
- (1) protein and (2) DNA
    

- Made two batches of bacteriophage
    

- Radioactively labeled protein (sulfur)
    
- Radioactively labeled DNA (phosphate)
    

- Mix radioactively labeled phages with bacteria
    
- Disconnect phages from bacterial cells
    
- Centrifuge so that the bacteria form a pellet
    
- Measure radioactivity in the pellet and the liquid
    

- The DNA is the material going in
    

Result: DNA determined to be hereditary material

  

4 Nucleotides

- Adenine
    
- Thymine (U instead of T in RNA)
    
- Cytosine
    
- Guanine
    

  

20 amino acids

  

3 billion nucleotides in each cell

  

Adenine binds to thymine

Guanine binds to cytosine

  

%adenine=%thymine

%guanine=%cytosine

AT the Golf Course

AT GC

Sugar phosphate backbone, and then the bases are on the tips, creating a weak hydrogen bond

  

Watson and crick stole rosalind franklin’s stuff

  

DNA is antiparallel

The strands are complementary

Either strand can act as the template

Each strand acts the template for the new strand (when the old strand is broken apart)

So one strand is old and one is new

  

How does DNA replicate (keep table for exam)

- DNA polymerase: synthesis new daughter strands using the information in the template strand
    
- Helicase: unwraps the DNA double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds 
    
- DNA ligase: recombines the strands 
    

  

1. Helicase: unwinds the DNA double helix and makes some space and aligns it for the next step
    
2. DNA polymerase: copies the template strand to make the new strand, but only in the 5’ to 3’ direction (on the leading strand)
    

3. In the other direction on the lagging strand, it makes some fragments and falls off and keeps going in that way (okazaki fragment)
    
4. DNA ligase helps to fill in the gaps between the fragments
    

  

The two identical sets of DNA created are called sister chromatids

  

The principles of DNA replication ca be mimicked in a lab to make copies

  

A Bay Area scientist was high in the 1980s and came up with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

1. Denaturation (causes the DNA strands to separate
    
2. Annealing (cool down)
    

3. A small piece of DNA is added
    
4. Targets segment of DNA to be copied
    

5. Heat up a bit
    

6. DNA polymerase added
    
7. Comes from a bacteria found in hot springs so it can handle the temp
    

  

Purpose of DNA

- Genes encode for proteins
    

  

Gene expression

- Not every gene gets converted to a protein in every cell type (all cells have same genetic material, but only some genes expressed)
    

- Two stages
    

- Transcription
    

- Transcribe DNA to RNA in the nucleus
    
- mRNA goes to the cytoplasm to the ribosome to be converted to a protein
    

- Start of a gene = promoter
    
- End of a gene = terminator
    

- RNA polymerase unwraps DNA
    
- Uses the template strand to make a complementary strand
    
- RNA copy
    

- Instead of thymine, uracil nitrogen-containing base is used
    

- Translation
    

- The mRNA is translated into amino acids in the nucleus
    
- Information read as a series of triplets (codons)
    
- Key players
    

- mRNA
    
- Ribosome
    

- Reads each codon to understand which amino acid to make 
    
- Looks for the start codon (AUG) methionine
    
- The tRNA brings in the amino acid
    
- Builds the protein
    

- tRNA molecules
    

- Contains an anticodon complementary to the codon and an amino acid
    
- Puts the amino acid through the ribosome to bind it
    

  

Allele: variation of a gene

- Small changes in the nucleotide sequence within the gene
    
- Not all changes cause a protein shape change
    

  

Chromosome

- DNA is tightly packed
    
- Consists of DNA and histones
    

- Nucleosome: DNA wrapped around a histone
    

- Nucleosomes are compressed together
    
- 22 autosomes
    
- 1 sex chromosome (XX - female, XY - male)
    
- Each gene has a specific location on a chromosome (locus)
    
- We have 2 copies of each gene
    

- We have two copies of each chromosome
    
- Maternal and paternal copy
    
- The two copies may be two different alleles
    

Sexual Reproduction

- Gametes contain only one copy of each chromosome (haploid)
    
- Meiosis
    

- Reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid
    
- Two rounds of cell division
    

- Meiosis I
    

- Prophase I
    

- Nucleus disintegrates
    
- Homologous chromosomes pair with each other
    

- Maternal chromosome next to paternal chromosome
    
- Form a tetrad
    

- Allele are shuffled from one homologous chromosome to the other
    

- Process: crossing over
    
- Produces a new combination of alles not present in the original chromosomes
    
- Source of genetic variation
    

- Metaphase I
    

- Chromosomes line up in the middle
    
- independent assortment
    

- How the chromosomes line up
    
- They randomly line up in the middle, creates possible variation
    

- Anaphase I
    

- Genetic material separates and goes to opposite ends
    

- Telophase I
    

- Separates the cell into two parts
    

- Meiosis II
    

- Prophase II
    

-   
    

- Metaphase II
    
- Anaphase II
    
- Telophase II
    

- 4 haploid cells
    

- Yields 4 haploid cells
    

  

Pattern of inheritance

- Gregor mendel
    

- Austrian monk
    
- Worked with pea plants
    

- Curous about patterns of inheritance
    
- If you crossed a green and yellow, they were all green
    

- GG / gg = Gg Gg Gg Gg
    
- Then cross the siblings
    

- Gg / Gg = GG Gg Gg gg
    

- Some traits dominate others
    

- Green is dominant to yellow
    
- Yellow is recessive to green
    

- Each individual contains two copies of a trait (gene) but only one copy is passed to the next generation
    

Law of Segregation

- Each individual has two factors of a trait
    
- Those factors segregate or separate when gametes form
    
- Fertilization produces a new individual with two factors
    

  

What if two traits were considered at one time (dyhybrid cross)

- Alleles are independent of each other
    

  

Table 3.2: Genetic Terms (keep for exam)

  

Inheritance pattern of sickle-cell anemia (gene)

- Pedigree
    

- Heterozygous people don’t have symptoms
    

  

incomplete dominance

- All of the dominant traits that Mendel looked at completely masked the recessive traits
    

- Green covered yellow
    
- Some traits do not completely mask the recessive gene
    
- Heterozygote expresses a phenotype that is an intermediate between the dominant and recessive phenotypes
    

  

Multiple allele inheritance

- 300 different alleles cause cystic fibrosis
    
- Human ABO blood groups
    

- Three alleles
    

- I^A produces the A antigen
    
- I^B produces the B antigen
    
- I does not produce any antigens
    

- This allele is recessive
    

- Type A blood: IA IA or IA i
    
- Type B blood: IB IB or IB i
    
- Type AB blood: IA IB
    

- Universal acceptors
    

- Type O blood: ii
    

- Universal donors
    

  

Does environment play a role

- Skin color
    

- More/less skin darkness: more/less dominant alleles
    
- More sun = more expression of melanin
    

  

Other complications

- Epistatic interaction
    

- The dominant form of the OCA2 gene yields brown eyes
    
- A recessive OCA2 gene yield blue eye
    
- The HERC2 gene can override th dominant OCA2
    

- The individual can have two copies of the dominant OCA2
    
- But they have to have two recessive copies of HERC2
