== operator

- Compares 2 variables (primitives or references
    
- On the stack, not the heap
    

- True iff variable are identical (same bit pattern)
    

- Stack equality
    

  

equals() is a method mentioned in object

- You need to override for classes
    

  

Hashset and Treeset

- hashCode() = x%7
    

  

hashCode()

- Inherited from object
    
- Returns an int
    
- You have to override if you want your classes to have superpowers (with @Override)
    
- Returns some function of te values of the instance variables
    

  

equals/hashcode contract

- Given any 2 objects x and y, if x.equals(y) is true, then
    

- x.hashCode() must equal y.hashCOde()
    
- Collisions should be rare
    

  

hashSet()

- Every item must be unique
    
- Checks for prior presence
    
- But we still have to add hashCode() and respect the contract
    
- Quicker than ArrayList
    
- Like ArrayList but order is arbitrary and not repeatable
    
- Donâ€™t access by location
    

  

Equals and compareTo for treeSet

- a.equals(b) <-> a.compareTo(b) is 0
    

  

Hashset

- No duplicate members
    
- Traversal order is arbitrary and not repeatable
    
- Insertion time is constant and small, regardless of size
    

  

treeSet

- No duplicate members
    
- Traversal order is determined by compareTo()
