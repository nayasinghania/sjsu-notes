Biodiversity: variation of life forms across a system

- genetic diversity: total num of genetic characteristics in genetic makeup of a species
    
- Species: diversity within ecological community
    
- Ecosystem: variety of different habitats on the planet
    

  

Keystone vs indicator species

- Keystone: has huge impact on environment, but may have low population numbers, supports entire ecosystems
    

- otters
    

- Indicator species: indicate health of an environment
    

- Lichen: sensitive to certain pollutants
    

  

Threats to biodiversity

- HIPPO (bolded ones are the 3 largest threats)
    

- Habitat loss
    
- Invasive species
    
- Population of humans
    
- Pollution
    
- Overexploitation
    

  

Humans and the environment

- Global climate change
    
- Plastics/single-use water bottles
    

- ~1000 years to begin to biodegrade plastic water bottle
    

- Tropical rainforest deforestation
    
- Global impact of developed nation's food choices
    
- Biodiversity loss
    

- Species loss caused by human activity (current mass extinction)
    

- Pollution
    

- Oil at peak right now, only going to decline from here
    
- Clean air act of 1970
    
- Photochemical smog
    
- Temp inversion: cool air trapped under warmer air (prevent air from circulating)
    
- Asbestos, formaldehyde, radon -> sick building syndrome (due to poor ventilation)
    
- Chlorofluorocarbons contribute to depletion of ozone layer
    

- Human overpopulation
    

- ~10 billion people by 2050
    
- Zero growth: each couple only produces 2 offspring, education on birth control, govt incentives to limit children, education (biggest contributor)
