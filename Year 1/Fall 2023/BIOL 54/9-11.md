- Proteins
    
- Fats
    
- Carbohydrates
    

- Vitamins
    
- Minerals
    
- Waters
    
- A healthful diet

Obtaining essential nutrients

- Water
    

- Prevent dehydration
    
- Bathes cells
    
- Aids in fluid and electrolyte balance
    
- Transports molecules and cells
    
- Constitutes major components of blood
    

- Proteins
    

- Function: growth and energy supply
    
- Types: break down into amino acids
    

- Complete proteins (containing all essential amino acids): animal products and some plant products
    
- incomplete proteins: grains, dry beans, nuts
    

- Carbohydrates
    

- Function: primary energy source, especially in brain
    
- Types
    

- Simple: natural sugars and added sugars; high glycemic index
    
- Complex: grains, cereals, veggies, beans; low glycemic index
    

- Glucose
    

- C6H12O6

- Create ATP
    

- Fats
    

- Function: vital role in maintaining healthy skin and hair, insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function
    
- Triglycerides are the most common (comes from excess calories too) (95% of body fat)
    
- Cholesterol: remaining 5% of body fat, can accumulate as plaque on inner artery walls
    

- LDL: bad
    
- HDL: good
    

- MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids)
    
- PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids)
    
- Trans fats (polyunsaturated oils hydrogenated to make them more solid): raise LDL and lower HDL
    

  

Vegetarianism

- Advantages
    

- Better cholesterol levels
    
- Increase GI function
    
- Lower risk of heart disease
    
- Decrease carbon footprint
    
- Decrease antibiotic resistance
    
- Save water
    

- Disadvantages
    

- Possible vitamin deficiencies
    

  

Vitamins

- Functions: helps put macromolecules to use
    
- Essential to regulating growth, maintaining tissue, and releasing energy from blood, involved in manufacturing blood cells, hormones, and other compounds
    
- B and C are water soluble, rest are fat soluble
    

  

Antioxidants

- Oxidative stress
    
- Free radicals
    
- Vitamin C and E, beta-carotene, and other carotenoids, and selenium
    

- Lycopene
    
- Lutein
    

- Walnuts
    
- All berries
    
- Tomatoes
    
- Peaches

- Types
    

- Macro: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, etc
    
- Trace; iron, iodine, fluoride, etc
    

  

Food additives

- Added to reduce foodborne illness, prevent spoilage, and enhance the way foods look and taste
