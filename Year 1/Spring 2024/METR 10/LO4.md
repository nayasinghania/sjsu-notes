Convection

- Heat transfer by fluid
    

- Air, water, etc
    
- Not usually solids
    
- Vertica;
    
- Rising of hot air and sinking of cold air
    
- Uneven heating and cooling of earth’s surface
    
- Cold air is denser
    
- Thermals are pockets of warmer air
    

- Rising bubble of air
    

  

Radiation

- Doesn’t require the space between being heated
    
- Travels as EM waves (properties of electricity and magnetism
    
- Travels at speed of light in a vacuum
    
- Light bends as it slows down
    
- Measured by frequency and wavelength
    
- Smaller wavelengths have more energy per wave/photon
    
- 1 micrometer = 0.000001 m = 10 ^ -6 m
    
- Smaller wavelengths at higher temperatures (usually)
    
- Everything with a temperature above absolute 0 emit radiation
    
- The wavelengths of radiation emitted by objects depends on the object’s temperature. The higher the object’s temperature, the shorter the wavelengths emitted
    
- Objects with a high temperature emit radiation at a greater rate or intensity than objects with a lower temperature
    

  

Phase Change

- Hidden transfer
    
- Temperature is the measure of the average speed of atoms and molecules
    
- Heat is energy in the process being transferred from one object to another because of the temperature difference between them
    
- Latent heat (hidden heat)
    
- Sensible heat (heat we feel)
    
- Liquid water to water vapor
    

- More energetic molecules escape from a droplet of water, decreasing avg molecular motion
    
- Energy is needed from other sources
    
- Cooling process
    
- latent heat
    

- Water vapor to liquid water
    

- Energy will reappear as sensible heat
    
- Warming process
    

- Sublimation
    
- Deposition
    

- Water vapor to ice
    

- Colder to warmer phase: cools environment
    
- Warmer to colder phase: warms environment
