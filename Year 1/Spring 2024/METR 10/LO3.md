Atmospheric structure

  

Atmosphere

- Gasses surrounding planet
    

  

Thermosphere

- Warmer with height
    
- ~ 500 C / 900 F
    
- Few air molecules
    
- Auroras (northern and southern lights)
    

  

Mesosphere

- Mysterious
    
- 50-85 km
    
- Colder with height
    
- Mesopause divides this part and thermosphere
    

  

Stratosphere

- Ozone layer
    
- 10-50 km
    
- Warmer with height
    
- Stratopause divides this part and mesosphere
    

  

Troposphere

- Location of weather
    
- 0-10 km
    
- Colder with more height
    
- Tropopause divides this part and stratosphere
