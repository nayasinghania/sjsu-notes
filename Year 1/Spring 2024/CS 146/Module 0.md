Data structure

- Specialized format for organizing and storing data in memory so that it can be used efficiently and easily
    
- Operations are insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, sorting
    
- Notations
    

- Infix (operators written in between operands)
    
- Postfix (operators are written after their operands
    
- Prefix (operators are written before their operands
    

  

Linear data structures

- Homogeneous elements
    
- Elements are in a sequence and form a linear series
    
- Easy to implement, since computer memory is linearly organized
    
- Ex. stack, queue, linked lists
    
- Queues and stacks can be implemented using arrays and linked lists
    

  

Non-linear data structures

- Data item is connected to several other data items
    
- Exhibit either hierarchical or parent-child relationship
    
- Not sequentially arranged
    
- Ex. trees, graphs
    

  

Stack

- Ordered list
    
- LIFO or FILO
    
- Insert with push()
    
- Delete with pop()
    
- Point to current newest element with top()
    
- Insertion and removal only allowed at one end: top
    
- Stack overflow is a full stack
    
- Stack underflow is an empty stack
    
- Ex. undo mechanisms, recursion/function calling, expression conversion/evaluation, reversing words
    
- Can be implemented with 2 queues
    
- Used for DFS
    
- DFS can also be implemented using recursion (recursion also uses function call stack)
    

  

Queue

- Ordered list
    
- FIFO
    
- Inserted at rear end aka enqueue
    
- Removed from front end aka dequeue
    
- Ex. hardware queues, network routers, operating systems (CPU scheduling), airport takeoff
    
- Can be implemented with 2 stacks
    
- Used for BFS
    

  

Priority queue

- Each item has some predefined priority
    
- Does not support FIFO
    
- An element can be inserted or removed from any position depending on their priority
    
- insert() adding item at array end in O(1) time
    
- getHighestPriority() linearly searches the highest priority item in array in O(n) time
    
- deleteHighestPriority() first linearly searches an item, then removes the item by moving all subsequent items one position back
    
- Using linked list, time complexity of all operations remains same as array
    

- It can make deleteHighestPriority() more efficient as we donâ€™t have to move items
    

  

Disadvantage of arrays

- Static memory allocation
    
- Max size reserved in advance
    

- Problems of less resource utilization
    

- Different data types cannot be stored in an array
    

  

Linked list

- Group of nodes in a sequence
    
- Each node contains data and node references
    
- Ex. making any list, basic of dynamic memory management, efficient memory management
    
- Singly linked
    

- Node has data and reference to next node
    
- Operations are insertion, deletion, traversal
    

- Doubly linked
    

- Node has data and reference to next and previous node
    

- Circularly linked
    

- Can be singly or doubly linked
    
- First and last node are connected
    
- No null node at the end
    

  

Tree

- Binary
    

- Hierarchical
    
- Each node has 2 children at most (left and right child)
    
- Topmost node is the root
    
- Is BST if the inorder traversal of a binary tree is sorted
    

- Ex. searching, time, geography, ancestry
    

  

Graph

- A pictorial representation of a set of objects, where some pairs of objects are connected by links
    
- The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices (V) and the links that connect the vertices are called edges (E)
    
- A pair of sets (V,E) where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, connecting the pairs of vertices
    
- Ex. almost any complex problem, network nodes
    
- Undirected
    

- Loop
    
- Multiple arc
    

- Directed
    
- Weighted
    

  

Recursion

- A procedure calls itself
    
- Procedure a calls procedure b which in turn calls procedure a again
    
- Visualizing
    

- Each node can be a procedure
    
- Each edge (connection) represents a procedure call
    
- Forms a circle
    

- Recursion first builds a stack with recursive calls
    
- It then pops the results (return values) in the opposite direction
