- Congress doesn’t have the expertise to deal with regulations
  - NASA
    - Scientists designing rockets
  - NHTSA
    - Civil engineers designing highways

    - Environmental scientists
- The Congress can place blame on the agencies
  - They don’t want the electoral blame
  - The bureaucracy has to enforce unpopular decisions/regulations

  - Keeping an eye on the agencies and departments
    - Make sure the bureaucracy doesn’t overstep their power/responsibilities
      - Police patrol
        - Ask bureaucracy to file reports, testify before Congress, explain spending
        - Checking often to make sure things are going properly
        - More likely to be engaged in
          - Give electoral advantages
      - Fire alarm
        - Waiting for something to go wrong within a bureaucratic department
          - E.g. E. coli outbreak during Obama administration
            - E. coli entered the food system via bad slaughtering practices
            - Was found that food safety inspection service wasn’t inspecting enough
