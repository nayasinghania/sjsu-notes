Direct Democracy in CA

- Initiative - two types
  - Citizen-made laws
  - Both below percentages are only for getting the law on the ballot
  - Statutory (make/change a state law)
    - Requires signatures (of registered voters) equal to 5% of the number of people who voted in the last gubernatorial (governor’s) election
  - Constitutional (amend the state constitution)
    - That number is 8%
  - Criticisms of the initiatives in CA
    - Only rich people and corporations and rich groups can afford to get these initiatives on the ballot
    - Many complex initiatives - most people don’t have the expertise for it
      - This is why elect representatives - we are electing someone with expertise to make these decisions
    - Competing measures can be confusing
- Referendum
  - Voters can approve or reject acts of the state legislature
    - 5% signature requirement
    - These are pretty rare
- Recall
  - Ability to recall elected representatives
  - 12% signature requirement
    - Maybe should be higher amount
      - Expensive to run recall elections
  - Most prominent (and recent) - Governor Gray Davis (2003) recalled, recall of Governor Gavin Newson failed
