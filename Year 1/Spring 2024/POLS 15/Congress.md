HABBAL (How A Bill Becomes A Law)

- Anyone can help draft a bill
- A bill can be introduced on either side
  - Revenue bills must start in the house of representatives
- The bill goes straight to committee
  - Goes to the relevant committee
- The bill goes to the subcommittee
  - Bill is marked up
  - 15% make it out
  - Marked up bill has to be approved
    - Goes back to the committee
    - Gets marked up
    - If it makes it out of the committee process
- House specific
  - Rules committee puts a bunch of rules on it
    - open/closed/restricted rule
      - Open rule - can have amendments
      - Closed rule - cannot have amendments
      - Restricted rule - can only have some amendments
    - How long to debate the bill
    - They can put rules to kill the bill
  - Then goes to the floor
    - Debates for however long they’re allowed
  - Then house votes yes or no
- Senate specific
  - No rules committee for the bill
  - Everything done through unanimous consent for all the rules
  - Need a filibuster proof majority
    - 60 votes
- After both chambers pass the bill, they have to reconcile the two versions of the bill (one per chamber)
  - If it's not already the same version, a conference committee with members from the senate and house (republicans and democrats)
  - It has to go back to both chambers to get voted on by both chambers
- Then the bill goes to the president
  - An enrolled bill is one that has been presented to the president
  - The president has multiple options
    - Sign it
    - Veto it
    - Ignore it (will pass automatically after 10 days)
    - Pocket veto
      - If congress goes out of session within the 10 days it gets vetoed
  - Line item veto	/ item veto
    - They could veto parts of a bill
    - Striking out line items
    - Could only be done with spending bills
    - This was struck down the supreme court
      - Violated separation of powers doctrine
        - Because the president would be altering legislation by line item vetoing
          - Essentially creating new legislation
      - Presentment law
        - Enrolled bill presented to the president
        - Line item veto not a constitutional option
          - You would have to amend the constitution for that 
    - Governor newsom can do line item veto
      - Because the California constitution gives him that power
      - Therefore this did not get struck down in california because
- Process not over after president signs the bill
