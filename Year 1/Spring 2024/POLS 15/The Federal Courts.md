The power of the Court

  - Argument about the powers of the Supreme Court in a favorable manner
  - Trying to calm the fears of the anti-federalists
  - Argument
    - Unelected and life-tenure
      - Does not have to be responsive to voters or cater to voters
      - They are only responsive to the constitution
    - No power of the sword
    - No power of the purse
    - Not a threat to the other two branches
    - Keep the legislature responsive (and the president too)
- Anti-federalist fear of a powerful federal government
  - Court will substitute its will
  - Court will be superior
