Let A be an m x n matrix 

Let b be a vector in IR

Consider the system Ax = b

  

1. Any solution x to the normal equations (A^T A)z = Ab is a best approximation to Ax = b in the sense that || Az - b || <= ||Ax - b|| for all x in IR
    
2. If the columns of A are linearly independent then A^T A is invertible and z is the unique solution z = (A^T A)^-1 A^T b
    

  

If you have an inconsistent system A

  

Do A^T A = … (multiply the matrices) = …

  

The A^T A matrix is symmetric (same if transposed or not)

  

Do A^T b (multiply A^T by the vector A)

  

Now do z = (A^T A) A^T b

  

Augment A^T A with b

  

A minimizer is the constants from each vector value
