The null space of a matrix A is the subspace null(A) = {x such that Ax = 0 }

The solutions to the homogeneous system

  

The row space of an m x n matrix A is the subspace of IR^n spanned by the rows of A row(A0 = span(R_1, R_2, …, R_m)

  

The column space of an m x n matrix A is the subspace of IR^n spanned by the columns of A col(A) = span(c_1, c_2, …, c_n

  

The image or range of a linear transformation is the subspace im(A) or range(A) given by { Ax where x in IR^n }

How do we find all possible outputs

  

If A -> B by elementary row operations then row(A)=row(B)

  

If R is a row-echelon matrix 

1. The nonzero rows or R are a basis for row IR
    
2. The columns of R that contain a leading 1 are a basis for col R
    

  

The rank of a matrix is the number of leading 1s in row echelon form

  

rank(A) = dm(row(A))=dim(col(A))

  

Let A be a m x n matrix with rank r. If A is row-reduced to REF R then 

1. The nonzero rows of R are a basis for row(A)
    
2. The r columns of A that contain a leading 1 in REF are a basis for col(A)
