## Introduction
- Originally intended for simulation and verification of digital circuits
- With the addition of synthesis capability, it has become popular for use in design entry for CAD systems
	- These CAD systems are used to synthesize Verilog into a hardware implementation of the described circuit
## Representation of Digital Circuits
- When using CAD tools to synthesize a logic circuit, the designer can provide the initial description of the circuit in several ways, one way being Verilog source code
- The Verilog compiler translates this code into a logic circuit
- Verilog allows the designer to describe a desired circuit in many ways
	- One way is to use Verilog constructs that describe of the circuit in terms of circuit elements
- A larger circuit defined by writing code that connects such elements together
	- This approach is referred to as the *structural* representation of logic circuits
- Another possibility is to describe a circuit more abstractly by using logic expressions and Verilog programming constructs that define the desired behavior of the circuit, but not its actual structure in terms of gates
	- This is called the *behavioral* representation
### Structural Specification of Logic Circuits
#### Gates
- Verilog includes a set of *gate-level primitives* that correspond to commonly-used logic gates
- A gate is represented by indicating functional name, output, and inputs
##### Examples
- Two input [AND](2%20-%20Symbolic%20Logic.md#AND) gate with output $y$ and inputs $x_1,x_2$
	- `and(y, x1, x2)`
- Four input OR gate
	- `or(y, x1, x2, x3, x4)`
- One input NOT gate implementing $y=\overline{x}$
	- `not(y, x)`
#### Syntax
##### Example
![](Attachments/Logic%20Gate%20Example.png)
```verilog
module example1(x1, x2, s, f):
	input x1, x2, s;
	output f;
	not(k, s);
	and(g, k, x1);
	and(h, s, x2);
	or(f, g, h);
endmodule
```
