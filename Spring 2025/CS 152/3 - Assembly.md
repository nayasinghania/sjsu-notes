| High Level Code | MIPS Assembly Code             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $a=b+c$         | `add a, b, c`                  |
| $a=b-c$         | `sub a, b, c`                  |
| $a=b+c-d$       | `sub t, c, d`<br>`add a, b, t` |
## Memory
- Commonly used variables are kept in registers
- By using a combo of memory and registers a program can access a large amount of data fairly quickly
- Drawn with low memory addresses toward bottom and high memory addresses toward top
- Byte-addressable memory (each byte has a unique address)
- MIPS uses 32 bit memory addresses and 32 bit data words
## Instruction Types
### R Type
- Register type instruction
- 3 registers for operands
- 2 registers for sources
- 1 register for destination
- Each field is 5 or 6 bits
- op (6), rs (5), rt (5), rd (5), shamt (5), funct (6)
### I Type
- Immediate type instruction
- 2 registers for operands
- 1 immediate operand
- op (6), rs (5), rt (5), imm (16)
- Do the twos complement for imm if it overshoots
### J Type
- Jump type instruction
- Used only with jump instructions
- op (6), addr (26)
## The Power of the Stored Program
- A machine language program is a series of 32-bit numbers representing the instructions
- These instructions can be stored in memory 
	- This is the *stored program* concept
- Instructions in stored programs are *fetched* from memory and executed by the processors
- In MIPS programs, the instructions are stored starting at address $0x004000000$ 
	- Byte addressable
	- A 32-bit (4 byte) instruction addresses advance by 4 bytes
	- Imperative paradigm
## Arithmetic and Logical Instructions
- the AND instruction is useful for masking bits (forcing unwanted bits to 0)
### Shift Instructions
- Shifts the value in a register let or right by up to 31 bits
- Shift operations multiply or divide by powers of two
### Multiplication and Division Instructions
- Multiplying two 32-bit numbers produces a 64-bit number
- Dividing two 32-bit numbers produce a 32-bit quotient and 32-bit remainder
### Branching
#### Conditional Branching
- Two conditional branch instructions
- Branch if equal (beq)
- Branch if not equal (bne)
- Written as $beq,\$rs,\$rt,imm$
	- This order is reversed from most I-type instructions
##### If/Else Statements
- bne, add
##### Switch Statements
- case#
- addi, bne, addi
##### While Loops
##### For Loops
### Jump
- Jump (j) directly to the instruction at the specified label
- Jump and link (jal) is similar to j but is used by procedures to save a return address
- Jump register (jr) jumps to the address held in a register
### Arrays
