## Fallacies of Relevance
>[!definition]
>Mistakes in reasoning that occur because the premises are logically irrelevant to the conclusion
### Relevance

#### Positive Relevance
>[!definition]
>A statement that counts in favor to another statement
#### Negative Relevance
>[!definition]
>A statement that counts against another statement

#### Logical Irrelevance
>[!definition]
>A statement that counts neither for or against another statement

>[!example]
>- The earth revolves around the sun. Therefore, marijuana should be legalized
### Fallacies
#### Personal Attack (Ad Hominem)
>[!definition]
>Rejecting someone's argument or claim by attacking the other person rather than the person's argument or claim

>[!example]
>Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy magazine, has argued against censorship of pornography. But Hefner is an immature, self-indulgent millionaire who never outgrew the adolescent fantasies of his youth. His argument, therefore, is worthless.
## Fallacies of Insufficient Evidence
>[!definition]
>Mistakes in reasoning that occur because the premises, though logically relevant to the conclusion, fail to provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion
