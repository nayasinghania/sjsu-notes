>[!definition]
>Something that the speaker [assumes](../Introduction%20to%20Critical%20Thinking.md#Assumption) to be the case prior to making an utterance

>[!example]
>Mary's brother bought 3 horses
>- A person exists named Mary
>- Mary has a brother

If we say that the sentence contains the proposition $p$ and the sentence contains the proposition $q$, we can represent the relationship as $p >> q$ 
>[!example]
>- Mary's dog is cute ($p$)
>- Mary has a dog ($q$)
>- $p >> q$
## Consistency Under Negation
>[!definition]
>The presupposition of a statement will remain constant (still true) even when the statement isnt negated

>[!example]
>- Mary's dog is not cute (NOT $p$)
>- Mary has a dog ($q$)
>- NOT $p >> q$

## Types
### Potential Presupposition
- Can only become actual presuppositions in contexts with speakers
### Existential Presupposition
- Is not only assumed to be present in possessive constructions, but more generally in any definite noun phrase
### Factive Presupposition
- With structure similar to "Everyone knows that $q$"
- Verbs like know, realize, regret, be, aware, glad, odd
### Non Factive Presupposition
- Verbs like dream, imagine, and pretend
