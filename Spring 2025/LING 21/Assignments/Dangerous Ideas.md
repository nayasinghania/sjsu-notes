1. Dangerous ideas will continue to be introduced into society if we as a society continue to decry science as heresy.
	-  I would agree with this mainly because if we as a society cannot accept factual science, important discoveries will continue to be viewed as dangerous ideas, which will hinder progress of society.
2. Only children can benefit from engaging in delusional thinking, or believing that unrealistic things will come true. 
	- I would agree with this as well because beyond a certain point, not being realistic is not going to really help you get anywhere in life.
