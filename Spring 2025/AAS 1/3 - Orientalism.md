## The Colonial Imagination
- A Eurocentric master narrative tends to position Europeans as the first explorers and the rest of the world as an uncivilized frontier to be discovered and conquered
- The American circus exploited the western imagination of the East
- Orientalism is a [racist](2%20-%20Race.md) ideology
### Okihiro's Points
- Asia and the Pacific existed as civilizations long before European contact
- Europeans knew this, which is why they set out looking for Asia
- European colonialism brought not only systems such as capitalism, evangelism, and slavery, but also a world-view.
- That world-view mapped the world in the way that we understand it today
