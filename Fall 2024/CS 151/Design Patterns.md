## Strategy Design Pattern

Closed for modification, open for extension
### Design Principle #1
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
* Take the parts that vary and [[Pillars of OOP#2 - Encapsulation|encapsulate]] them in a class
	* You can later alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.
### Design Principle #2
* …
### Design Principle #3
* Favor composition over inheritance
* The **has a** relationship is interesting
* Creating systems using composition …
## Observer Pattern
* The Subject object manages some important data
* When data in the Subject changes, the observers are notified
* The observers (Observer Objects) have subscribed to (registered with) the Subject to receive updates when the Subject's data changes
* New data values are communicated to the observers in some form when they change
![[observers|500]]
* The observer can subscribe or unsubscribe to the subject
* A one to many dependency between objects
	* When one object changes state
	* all of its dependents are notified/updated automatically
### Design Principle #4
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interaction
## Singleton Design Pattern
* How to prevent more than one object from being instantiated?
* If we make the constructor private, an instantiation of an object can only be made inside the class
* This also allows the class to have a global point of access for the program to access
* `static` is global
```java
static uniqueInstance

public static synchronized Singleton getInstance {
	if (uniqueInstance == null) {
	uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
	}
	return uniqueInstance;
}
```
### Threading
* Two instances could get made if there are executions on multiple threads
* Make a method `synchronized` to make every thread wait its turn so no two threads cannot enter the method at the same time (`syncronized` disallows concurrency)
* Below code improves performance - not relevant in such a small program though
```java
private volatile static Singleton uniqueInstance
private Singleton() {}

public static Singleton getInstance() {
	if (uniqueInstance == null) {
		synchronized (Singleton.class) {
			if (uniqueInstance == null) {
				uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
			}
		}
	}
	return uniqueInstance
}
```
### Enums
* Using an enum to create a Singleton can help with synchronization issues
```java
public enum Singleton {
	UNIQUE_INSTANCE;
	// more useful fields here
}

public class SingletonClient {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Singleton singleton = Singleton.UNIQUE_INSTANCE;
		// use the singleton here
	}
}
```

* constructor must be private or package private

### Another Method
* make everything static in one class

## Decorator
* "Decorating" a class
* "Decorates" an object
	* Like a "wrapper" for an object
## Adapter
* The adapter converts one interface into another
```java
public class TurkeyAdapter implements Duck {
	Turkey turkey;
	public TUrkeyAdapter(Turkey turkey) {
		this.turkey = turkey;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void quack() {
		turkey.gobble();
	}

	@Override
	public void fly() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			turkey.fly();
		}
	}
}
```
## Abstract Design Pattern
* Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

## Factory Design Pattern
* Abstract top level class
* Concrete subclasses
* Concrete subclasses for the actual thing
* Subclasses instantiated by the factory methods
* ex. Pizza store -> NY Pizza Store, California Pizza Store -> NY Cheese Pizza, NY Pepperoni Pizza, California Cheese Pizza, California Pepperoni Pizza
	* Abstract pizza store
	* You can define your own concrete stores and concrete pizzas
## Abstract Factory Pattern
* The abstract factory pattern provides families of classes without concrete subclasses
* separate interfaces for each family of classes (e.g. each type of topping)
