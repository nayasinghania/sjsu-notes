> A point estimator of $\theta$ is denoted by $\hat{\theta}$
### Biased and Unbiased Estimators

> [!info] Definition
> A point estimate $\hat{\theta}$ is said to be an **unbiased estimator** of $\theta$ if $E(\hat{\theta})=\theta$ for every possible value of $\theta$. If $\hat{\theta}$ is not biased, the difference â€¦
