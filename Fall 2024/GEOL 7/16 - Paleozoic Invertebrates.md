## Continents
* Six major continents (before Pangaea)
### Epeiric Seas
* Formed on the shelves during episodes of transgressions
## Avalon Explosion
* The [[15 - Abiogenesis and the Precambrian Earth#Ediacaran Fauna (550 - 635 MYA)|Ediacaran Fauna]] were the first wide-spread group of animals that were complex and diverse
* This population boom occurred rather quickly at the end of the Precambrian
* May be first multicellular fauna
* Peaked around 570-580 MYA but began earlier
### Invertebrates
#### Dickinsonia
* Wide slug
* Possibly first animal
#### Spriggina
* Trilobite-like animal
* Early prototype of an arthopod
#### Charnia
* Flexible blade like structure that would capture bits of organic nutrients floating by
* It was sessile (attached to the seafloor)
* Similar to coral
#### Kimberella
* Slug like creature
* Wavy corrugated fringe along the side
## Cambrian Explosion
* We start to see organic mineralization (shells, teeth, skeletons)
### Why?
* More predation, predators developed traits to help them capture prey
* Prey needed traits to help them defend themselves (exoskeletons, shells, vision, speed, ability to burrow)
* Many were both predator and prey
* Chemistry changes in ocean
* Lots of shoreline = lots of reefs
### Advantages of Shells and Exoskeletons
* Protection from predators
* Protection from UV light (most reefs in photic zone)
* When the tide goes out, shelled organisms don't dry out
* Promotes growth, like snails
### Creatures
#### Ottoia
* Predatory, carnivorous worm
* Creature that burrowed and had a probiscis that stuck out
#### Wiwaxia
* Scaly, armored, slug-like
#### Hallucigenia
* Worm like thing with many legs and spikes

#### Pelagic
* Live in the water column
	* Water from bottom to top
	* Not including the Benthos
##### Planktonic
* Microorganisms
* some macro organisms (some jellyfish)
##### Nektonic
* Fish
* Cephalopods (octopus, squid)
* Most jellyfish
#### Benthic
##### Epifauna
* Live on top of the ocean floor
* Some sessile (they don't move)
* Some mobile (they move)
* Some are a combination of sessile and mobile
##### Infauna
* Buried/burrowed into the mud

#### Phyla

##### Arthropoda
* "Jointed foot"
* Jointed exoskeleton made of chitin and sometimes calcite
* Bilateral
* Molts
* Complex, sensitive eyes and antennae
##### Echinodermata
* Five-fold symmetry
* Sea urchins, sand dollars, starfish, crinoids, sea cucumbers
* Regeneration of body parts
* Usually covered in hard plates
	* Name means spiny skin
* Variety of feeding habits
##### Cnidaria
* Also known as Coelenterates
* "Nettle-thingy"
* Coral
	* Polyps
		* Little animals that live on a branch of coral
	* Contains algae that gives it energy in exchange for shelter and $CO_2$
	* Also eats tiny plankton
* Anemone
	* Sting food with tentacles
	* Pulls food into mouth
	* Sessile
	* Like a large polyp
	* Finger trap
* Jellyfish
	* Like a large upside down polyp
	* Plankton and even larger prey
	* Mostly Nektonic
	* (Prey entangled and stung by tentacles)
* Stinging barbs called nematocysts

##### Mollusca
* Most have 
	* A soft body
	* A mantle
	* No segments (ex. like arthropods or vertebrates)
	* Most have calcareous shell
		* Inner (cuttlebone, belemnite)
		* Outer (snail, ammonoids, nautilus, almost all bivalves)
			* clams, oysters, mussels, scallops
###### Cephalopoda (Class)
* Octopus, squid, cuttlefish
* Ceph = head, Poda = foot/leg $\Rightarrow$ headfoot
* Some of the most intelligent invertebrates
	* Jet propulsion
	* Mantle
		* Encloses their guts (visceral mass)
		* Like skin, but also like muscle, down and across their backs
		* Useful body parts are made from mantle
		* Capable of secreting calcium carbonate to make shells with
	* Camouflage (can be active camouflage)
	* Only example of cephalopod with a shell today is a nautilus
* Orthoceras
	* Straight Horn
	* Ancestor of modern squid
	* Straight, chambered shell with siphuncle
	* Tentacles used for collecting food
	* Used water at "jet propulsion"
###### Gastropoda (Class)
* Gastro = stomach, poda = foot/leg $\Rightarrow$ bellyfoot
* Only mollusca to have moved on land
* Snails, slugs
* Extremely diverse
* Marine, freshwater, terrestrial
* Radula (licks things)
	* Lickers made of hardest organic substance of any thing alive
	* Rough tongue
###### Bivalvia (Class)
* Two shells (valves) hinged together
* Some burrow, swim, or are sessile
* Clams, oysters, mussels, scallops
* Gills used for breathing and collecting food
##### Tardigrades
* Eight legs
* Can survive extreme environments
* Since about 530 million years ago

## Ordovician Invertebrates
* Many pre-existing life from the Cambrian
* Reef systems now contain corals
### Brachiopods
* Armfoot
* Not a bivalve
* One shell bigger than the other
* Leg thing sticks out between larger and smaller
### Coral
* Breathe and gather food through internal gills
* Symbiotic algae
* Corals are called "polyps"
* Phylum Cnidaria
* Polyps live in the corallites
#### Rugose Coral
* Can be solitary
#### Tabulate Coral
* Long corallites
* Multiple tabula lines horizontally through the long corallites
* Always colonial
### Bryozoans
* Breathe and gather food through external lophophores
* Zooids
* Phylum Bryozoa
	* It has its own phylum
### Similarities between Coral and Bryozoans
* Both are colonial
* Both live in a calcite cup (theca)
* They both can form branching structures but other forms as well
* Both filter-feeders
* …
### First Mass Extinction
* Occurs at the end of the Ordovician Period
* Ice Age
* When plants moved onto land, photosynthesis boomed, and more carbon dioxide …
## Silurian and Devonian Invertebrates
### Gastropods
* Stomach foot
* Snails and slugs
* Shells that coils in pointed spiral
* Shell is one hollow space, grows larger as the gastropod grows larger
* Toothy tongue (radula)
### Eurypterids
* Arthropod
* Broad wing
* Swimmers (nektonic)
* Predators
* "Sea scorpions"
	* Likely the ancestors of today's scorpions
### Bivalves
* Mollusks
* Clams, oysters, scallops, mussels
* Two shells hinged together (left and right valve)
* Filter feeds and breathes through a gill
* Internal gills (brachiopods have external lophophores)
* The shells are mirror images (unlike brachiopods)
### Crinoids
* Echinoderms
* Related to starfish
* Long, skinny, noodle-like arms
* Feathery things to collect food
* Stalk/stem
* Holdfast
### Ammonoids
* Extinct Cephalopods (mainly with coiled shells)
* Chambered shells
* Shells are planar in shape and are divided into multiple chambers
* Predatory, with tentacles to grab food
* They would bring with food to their beak, in the center of the tentacles

## Carboniferous and Permian Invertebrates
* Slow decline in oceanic biodiversity
### Fusulinids
* Looks like rice
* Type of Foraminifera Plankton
* Single-celled, appeared in Silurian
* Ubiquitous Carbonate Fossil
### Insects and Arachnids
* Appear to have origins in the sea, from marine arthropods such as eurypterids and the ancestors of horseshoe crab
* Earliest land fossils date from the Silurian, such as ancient millipedes and centipedes
* Many insects including dragonflies by the Carboniferous
