## Phylum Chordata
* Bilateral symmetry
* Spine or cartilage notochord
* Spinal cord
* Linear digestive tract
* Post-anal tail
### Pharyngeal Slits (Gills)
* All chordates begin as an embryo with gills, a tail, and no arms or legs
* For reptiles, mammals, and birds, these gills (gill arches) become part of our inner ear, jaw, and neck
### Invertebrates
* Tunicates
### Subphylum Vertebrata
* Animals with backbones and spinal columns
* 5% of all animal species
### Animals
#### Fish
* First true vertebrates on Earth
* Began when early chordates began to exhibit organic mineralization
	* Bones, shells, teeth, scales, etc.
##### Classification
* Lack or presence of a jaw
* shape of fin
* bony or cartilaginous
##### Ostracoderm
* Jawless
* Class Agnatha
* Late Cambrian to end of Devonian
* Armored plates
* Bottom-feeders, freshwater
* Gills only for breathing, not feeding
##### Teeth
* Cone tooth
* Conodont
###### Conodonts
* Teeth initial thought to be from worms, arthropods, mollusks, etc
* Eel-like jawless fish
* Up to 16 inches in length
* Teeth but no jaw (like a sieve)
* Maybe filter-feeding?
##### Jaws
* Early jawed fish
	* Placoderm
		* Plate-skinned
		* Silurian-Permian
		* Up to 12 m, various types
		* No teeth, bony plates instead
##### Lobe-Finned Fish
* One of these is a "living fossil"
* Crossopterygians
	* Most likely direct ancestors to amphibians
##### Tiktaalik
* "Large river fish"
* Neck
	* Could turn head left and right
* Well developed pectoral fins, with wrist, elbow, and shoulder
* Eyes towards top of head
* Could leave the water, but mostly stayed in the water
##### Ichthyostega
* First amphibian
##### Labyrinthodonts
###### Temnospondyls
###### Reptiliomorphs
* Develops amniotic egg (shelled egg that could be put on land)
	* Waste sac (allantois)
	* Yolk sac provides nutrients
* Lead to reptiles
#### Reptiles
* Earliest agreed-upon reptile was Hylonomus
* Late Mississippian
* Considered a protorothyrid
	* Earliest reptile
	* Diversified and replaced many amphibians
		* More mobile
		* More advanced jaws and teeth
		* Amniotic egg
		* Tougher skin
		* More efficient lungs
	* Protorothyrids evolved into Pelycosaurs
		* Dominant predator
		* Mostly went extinct by end of Permian
		* Fin-backed
		* Blood temperature regulation
		* Example
			* Dimetrodon
		* More like mammal-like reptiles, not reptiles or mammals
	* Therapsids evolved from Carnivorous Pelycosaurs
		* Official mammal-like reptiles (but not mammals or reptiles)
		* Sphenacodontia (new word for "mammal-like reptiles")
		* Synapsids
			* One opening (fenestra) in the skull behind each eye
			* Cheek bone
		* Diapsids
			* Reptiles and most birds
			* Two openings in the skull behind each eye
		* Cheek bone to help with jaw muscle attachment
		* Warm Blooded
		* Larger jaw, complex and varied teeth
		* Legs more vertical (instead of splayed out)

Mammals 
Birds
### The Earliest Chordates
* Early-Middle Cambrian Period
* Notochords only, the earliest Chordates had not yet developed a backbone at this point
* We are not yet sure which earlier organisms they evolved from
	* May have evolved from echinoderms
#### Myllokunmingia
* One specimen known
* Early chordate
* Only one fossil exists
* History not well known (~518 Mya)
#### Pikaia
* Common primitive chordate from the Burgess Shale (515-505 Mya)
* Bilateral, has a …
* …
#### Haikouchthys
* May be first known vertebrate (~515 Mya)

#### Class Veticul
